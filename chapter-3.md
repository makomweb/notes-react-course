## Using create-react-app

_create-react-app_ is used to set up boilerplate

Use `npm install -g create-react-app` to install this tool.

Use `create-react-app react-complete-guide --scripts-version 1.1.5` to spin up the app creation process.

Change into the new created subfolder `react-complete-guide` and ...

Use `npm start` to run the app.

Open the browser [http://localhost:3000] to see the running app.

## Understanding the folder structure

`src` contains the app source files
`public` contains the index.html main entry into the app and public assets.
